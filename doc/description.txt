Description of xrowCDN

----------------
1. General / Installation
----------------
xrowCDN handles the rewriting of any internal URL to images / CSS / JS. It rewrites the internal location to any mapped bucket from AWS.
A Shell script and a cronjob care about getting the according files into the S3.

  Amazon S3 is storage for the Internet. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.
  Amazon S3 provides a simple web services interface that can be used to store and retrieve any amount of data,
  at any time, from anywhere on the web. It gives any developer access to the same highly scalable, reliable,
  fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of web sites.
  The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers.
